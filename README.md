# CollaborationConnectMe

#### 1. This project is a Collaborative Portal -ConnectMe.
#### 2. Basically Portal offers the social networking functionality to its User.
#### 3. There are Two Parts in this project. One is the normal Users and other is Admin. Admin is responsible to create BLog,Post a Job,Respond to the Job Applied by the other users and also grant admin rights to other user. Whereas, User can view the Blog and Job Posted by Admin. User Can read and comment on Blogs and can Apply for a Job they Like. User can make Friends and even do a Group Chat.
#### 4. The central Idea of developing this project is to use the Webservices and AngularJS Function is our Project.
#### 5. So I have divided the total Project Structure in to two Parts. FrontEnd with AngularJS(Client) and BackEnd(Spring RestFul Webserices(Services Provider)
#### 6. Frontend Project is about creating UI using HTML and using BootStrap and CSS to make it interactive. Also using Angular JS to make the project as purely Single Page Application.
#### 7. Using JavaScript Controllers and AngularJS Services we are calling the RestFul Services at the BackEnd.
#### 8. Backend Project is Spring Framework Oriented, created the Restful services to be used at the frontend side. Hiberntate is used an ORM tool to map the Java class directly with the Oracle Database.
